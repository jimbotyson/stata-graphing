We can make a table from a test.

```
import delimited https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ccaajim/results.csv, clear
egen avxm = rowmean(maths english history)

ttest avxm, by(gender)

return list

table (command) (result), \\\
  command(Normotensiv = r(mu_1) \\\
  Hypertensive = r(mu_2) \\\
  Diff = (r(mu_2)-r(mu_1)) \\\
  pvalue = r(p) : ttest avxm, by(gender)

``
```
